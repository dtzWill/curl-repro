# curl-repro
reproducing libcurl crash

CI is expected to "fail" since this is intended to reproduce a crash:
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dtzWill/curl-repro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dtzWill/curl-repro)

Oh hooray, travis did demonstrate the crash--it just doesn't happen every time.
